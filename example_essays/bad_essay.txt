This is a bad essay about things and other things. It is supposed to be about something important but it will not do that very well. First, the introduction is not really an introduction because it doesn't say anything clear. It kind of repeats itself and then moves on to another sentence that is supposed to be interesting but is not.

The main body does not have a main idea. There are a lot of words that mean nothing together. For example, one could write about history but then mention science and pizza in the same sentence and that would count as unity maybe but probably not. It is important to be vague so the reader is confused. Also, do not use transitions because they make the essay flow and we do not want flow.

One paragraph tries to have evidence but it fails because there are no citations and no facts. It says things like "many people say" and "some experts might agree" and that should be convincing, but it is not. Repetition helps to fill space: many people, many people, many people. Repeating the same phrase makes the essay seem longer, which is a goal.

The conclusion restates nothing and ends abruptly. It might say "in conclusion" and then say something unrelated like "therefore, purple is important." This surprises the reader and leaves them thinking, which might be okay or might be annoying. Overall, the essay fails at clarity, organization, and purpose, which is what makes it a bad essay. The end.
